# Cat_Classifier_NN
 
 Logictic Regression with Neural Network
 In this notebook I built my first image recognition algorithm : 
 A cat classifier that recognizes cats with decent accuracy!

Skills Learnt :

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

First we implement all the individual functions, then join them together to make the final "model" functions which will classify the input dataset.
